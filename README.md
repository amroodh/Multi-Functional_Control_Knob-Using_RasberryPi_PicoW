# Multi-Functional_Control_Knob-Using_RasberryPi_PicoW

## Overview
This project implements a multi-functional control knob using Raspberry Pi Pico. The control knob is designed to perform various tasks such as volume control, scrolling, selection, etc., using rotary encoder and push button inputs.

## Features
- Rotary encoder for precise control
- Push button for selection and mode switching
- LED indicators for status feedback
- Customizable functionality through programming

## Requirements
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Rotary encoder
- Push button
- LEDs
- Python (for programming the Raspberry Pi Pico)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ``
   git clone https://github.com/amroodh/Multi-Functional_Control_Knob-Using_RasberryPi_PicoW.git
   ``
2. Connect the hardware components as per the circuit diagram (provide or link to your circuit diagram).

## Usage
1. Compile and upload the Python code to the Raspberry Pi Pico.
2. Connect the control knob to the Raspberry Pi Pico.
3. Power on the Raspberry Pi Pico.
4. Use the rotary encoder to control various functions (e.g., volume, scrolling).
5. Press the push button to select options or switch modes.
